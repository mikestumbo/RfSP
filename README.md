## RenderMan for Substance Painter 2.x

This plugin exports your [Substance Painter](https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-painter) project as one or more RenderManAsset.

RenderManAsset is the format used by the preset browser that was introduced in [RenderMan For Maya](https://rmanwiki.pixar.com/display/REN/RenderMan+for+Maya) 21.0. It allows for easy material setup interchange and includes dependencies like textures or OSL shaders.

## Features

### ![Alt](RenderMan/icons/PxrDisney.png "PxrDisney") : Export to PxrDisney-based material

The asset will use the PxrDisney bxdf to re-create the Substance Painter material. There are limitations though:

* The Substance Painter project MUST use the pbr-metal-rough shader.
* normals MUST be in directx format.
* Opacity is not supported.

### ![Alt](RenderMan/icons/PxrSurface.png "PxrSurface") : Export to PxrSurface-based material

* The Substance Painter project MUST use the pbr-metal-rough shader.
* normals MUST be in directx format.
* Opacity is not supported.

## Requirements

This plugin will NOT work without the following software:

* Substance Painter 2.3+
* RenderMan Pro Server 21.0+
* RenderMan For Maya 21.0+
* [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/) (but not Python 3.x)

## Install

* Download a zip archive from the github page
* Un-zip the archive
* Copy the RenderMan folder inside Substance Painter's plugin folder.
  > OSX: `/Users/yourlogin/Documents/Substance Painter 2/plugins`

## Known Issues

* No progress indication during export: be patient !
  * It takes time to export the maps and turn them into textures. The plugin will print a message in the log when done.

## Usage

1. On first use, open the "configure" dialog.

   ![Alt](img/open_configure_dialog.jpg "open config dialog")

1. Fill ALL fields of the dialog and click "Save", otherwise the export will fail.

   ![Alt](img/configure_dialog.jpg "open config dialog")

1. Once this initial configuration is done, the settings will be remembered even if you close Substance Painter.

1. Open a SP project and click one of the pixar buttons in the shelf.

   Hint: _Only the first one (PxrDisney) works for now._

### 0.2.2

* new
  * Added metadata to the asset files: user, description, resolution.
  * Compatibility chunk holds Substance Painter version.

* Fixed
  * better match with PxrSurface. Updated rules.json to fix a number of issues:
    * roughness should not be linearized
    * metallicity should not be linearized
    * normal map should use directx orientation
  * exported normal map contains mesh normals + bump + normal map.

* code
  * Added a new "settings" section to rules.json to set node param values in the shading graph.
  * Some refactoring

### 0.2.1

* Fixed
  * Fix ui error in Substance Painter 2018 (was ok in SP 2.x)

### 0.2.0

* New
  * Added support for RenderMan 22.x.
    * REMEMBER to change the SP prefs to point to RenderMan 22.x
  * The assets are now named after the SP project's name.
* Fixed
  * The specular was incorrect when outputing for PxrSurface.
  * The correct renderman version number is saved in the asset file.
* code
  * Refactored file path management.
  * Used logging module instead of my own.
  * Doc strings and PEP-8 fixes

### 0.1.4

* Initial support for PxrSurface
  * Simply use the rough metal workflow in Substance Painter and it will be converted to work with PxrSurface.
  * Also fixed Issue #2, reported by dayelov. Thanks !

### 0.1.2

* windows file paths were not correctly serialized to json.
* mention python dependency in README
* Final cleanup was inadvertantly disabled
* Fixed incorrect path on windows.

### 0.1.1

* Added license text to all source files.

### 0.1.0

* Implemented configure dialog to specify the path to RenderMan Pro Server and RenderMan For Maya. This is necessary because SP uses javascript, a sandboxed language that can not get access to environment variables.
* Export all channels from all textureSets to png files.
* Implemented basic export to PxrDisney-based asset.
  * Each TextureSet will be exported as a RenderManAsset directory.
